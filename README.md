### [Web Page (Fullstack Web Debeloper)](http://fveracoechea.com/)

Website developed with MERN stack and my own fullstack framework based on javascript.
Therefore, this uses Server Side Render, Material-ui, Rxjs, Webpack, Redux, Folktale and something more.
In Addition, that's not only a static page, it has a CMS to manage the information and files that are visualized.
It's currently running on [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com)

It is under development ...
